## 💡 Philosophy

> **"This is the scar of my learning."**

I don't hide my early work. I document everything. Growth is visible through progression, not perfection.

- **Old work (Java-Projects):** Shows where I started
- **This portfolio:** Shows where I'm going
- **Daily practice (prac):** Shows I never stop
